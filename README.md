# MyFirstProgram-21092023
 My first program is to create a console application where I have learned about printing out values of different variables, texts. I have also learned about how an 'if-else' statement works and how a 'for-loop' works.

 # Summary
 - uses of 'Console.WriteLine()' to print out texts & values of variables.
 - use of 'Console.ReadLine()' to let users inout values asked for.
 - use of 'if-else' to check conditions.
 - use of 'for-loop' to generate values on each iteration.
